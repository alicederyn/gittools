Chris's git tools
=================

This project contains a set of git CLI tools maintained by cpurcell@palantir.com. The most stable is `git-graph-branch`, which displays a clean tree of your local git repository's branches, including forks and merges, whether the branch is in sync with origin (Stash/GitHub), and whether tests are currently passing in CI.

To use any of the tools, I recommend setting up git aliases to them (git-rebase-branch relies on this to function) in `~/.gitconfig`:

    [alias]
      graph-branch = ! ~/bin/gittools/git-graph-branch
      mirror = ! ~/bin/gittools/git-mirror
      rebase-branch = ! ~/bin/gittools/git-rebase-branch
      split-pick = ! ~/bin/gittools/git-split-pick

git graph-branch
----------------

    Usage: git-graph-branch [options]

    Symbols:
        ðŸ”·   This branch is in sync with a remote of the same name
        ðŸ”¶   This branch is out of sync with a remote of the same name
        âŒ›   A CI build is in progress for this branch
        ðŸ’š   A CI build has succeeded for this branch
        ðŸ”¥   A CI build has failed for this branch

    Options:
        -h --help               Show this screen.
        -w, --watch             Continue to watch for git repo changes after printing the graph.
        --profile               Profiles the app.
        -l, --local             Only display information available from the local git repo.
                                Continuous integration results will not be fetched.

To get the best out of git graph-branch, I recommend a few configuration changes to your git checkout (`/path/to/repo/.git/config`, or `~/.gitconfig` if you would like to make these changes to every checkout); these will also give you better defaults for several git commands.

    [branch]
      autosetupmerge = always  # sets upstream information when you run git checkout -b <branch>
    [remote]
      pushdefault = origin  # plain git push will continue to work as expected
    [gc]
      auto = 100000  # keeps branch history for longer
    [pull]
      rebase = true  # git-graph-branch assumes you always rebase remote changes
    [push]
      default = simple  # plain git push will continue to work as expected

If you have not used these defaults before, you may want to set up upstream information for your existing branches as a one-off. For instance, if `feature/foo` is going to be applied to `develop`, run `git branch feature/foo --set-upstream-to=develop`. Once you have made the config changes above, `git branch -b feature/foo` will set this upstream information for you when you create the branch.

git-graph-branch will then use this upstream information to determine a tree structure for your branches. For instance, you might see something like:

    â”€  cleanup/immutables ðŸ”·  ðŸ”¥
    â”¬  feature/java.8
    â”¼  feature/herc.strategy.api.plugin ðŸ”·  ðŸ’š 
    â”¼  feature/no.more.internal.cluster.dispatch.connection ðŸ”· ðŸ’š 
    â”œâ–¶â•´  feature/distTar-unbreakable ðŸ”·  ðŸ’š
    â”´  develop ðŸ”¶  ðŸ’š  â‘¡ unmerged
    â”€  workspace

In this case, `feature/java.8` is branched off `feature/herc.strategy.api.plugin`, which is branched off `feature/no.more.internal.cluster.dispatch.connection`, which itself is branched off of `develop` (and all four are passing CI tests!).
